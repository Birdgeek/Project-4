1. The most challenging aspect of writing this project was figuring out what needs to go where within the main game loop.
2. The easiest part was carrying over the knowledge of pictures and manipulating them
3. I would prioritize working on the bulk of the project first isntead of writing all of the main game state. I would have used bottom up instead of top down
4. The most benneficial thing was combining all of the skills we learned into one big project. Really brought everything together.
5. Get rid of the sound requirements, it seems annoying and just frustrating to test with.
